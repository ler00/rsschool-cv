<h4>My main goal at that moment is to study programming and to go to remote work.
I am trying my best to do this. I have a great desire for knowledge.
Currently, I am working as a logistician for a fuel company since March 2021. 
For about a year I worked as a leading photographer in a modeling agency and for six months as a designer-photographer. 
In the past I took photography courses. Unfortunately, there is no experience working in frontend yet.
